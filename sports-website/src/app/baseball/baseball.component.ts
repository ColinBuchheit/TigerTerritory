      summary: 'One week ago, the Missouri Tigers took a 10-9 win over the Missouri State Bears. It ended with some words between the teams and some fire was into the Bears. The Bears kept their scoring going, but Mizzou was just able to record two hits. Missouri State took a 11-0 win at home and split the home-and-home series with the Tigers. The Bears walked it off with a two-run homer. Mizzou ran out a parade of pitchers who have been injured this season. The first one did good, then it went downhill. The return of Sam Horn to the mound has been long awaited after it was announced that the pitcher/quarterback would need Tommy John surgery in February 2023. He took the mound to start the game against the Missouri State Bears. Horn tossed just eight pitches, but got a strikeout and one hit that he turned into a double play. The ball was then handed to right-hander Josh McDevitt to make his first appearance of the season.'
